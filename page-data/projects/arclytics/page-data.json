If you want more detail about the project please just click on the project link at the bottom of this page and the ReadME.md file does a better job explaining the project in greater detail.</p>\n<p>So first to give a bit of context about this project, it was done in collaboration with the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation(ANSTO) ‚ò¢Ô∏è to provide a web calculation tool of the phase transformations occurs within alloys as it cools down. The main feature of the web application is able to receive an input of the makeup of an alloy and display the results on a graph üìà that a user is able to go through any point in time and show phase transformation of the alloy. If the inputs are correct the graph should show something similar to below.</p>\n<p>Being able to understand and explain above is one of the challenges we had to face as none of us had material science as a background. We also needed to understand the code of one of the material scientists attempt at creating his own application that he built using Visual Basic and Visual Basic UI. The application itself was perfect for what he needed . However, it was difficult for anyone else to use his application. The UI was difficult to understand ü§î, lack of input validation‚úîÔ∏è and time üïí (The application ran very slow and even slower in my toaster computer). This made it difficult for him to share his application around with other material scientists/students that may want to use his application.</p>\n<p>As for the technologies used and why we used them. We decided to build it with <code class=\"language-text\">Mongo</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">React</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">Python/Flask</code> for the main ones. We wanted to use the latest technologies that we know and for those in the team not proficient in the technology were able to use the long break to catch learn üìö the language so that they wouldn't be encumbered with the task of doing university work and the project work. In saying that we also wanted to work the latest standards for development methodologies we used a agile/scrum method and completed around 8 sprint cycles üèÉ throughout the project.</p>\n<details>\n\t<summary>Below were the technologies üë®‚Äçüíª we used: </summary>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Anaconda</li>\n\t\t<li>Docker</li>\n\t\t<li>Docker-Compose</li>\n\t\t<li>Docker-Machine</li>\n\t\t<li>Kubernetes</li>\n\t\t<li>Dask</li>\n\t\t<li>Flask</li>\n\t\t<li>NodeJS</li>\n\t\t<li>npm</li>\n\t\t<li>React</li>\n\t\t<li>Plotly</li>\n\t\t<li>Redis</li>\n\t\t<li>MongoDB</li>\n\t\t<li>Swagger</li>\n\t</ul>\n</details>\n<p>As a retrospective about this project. The experience has taught me a lot about industry standard programming (though most of it was self taught) and working in a highly motivated team (as most group projects I had always had someone not working) </p>\n<h1>Important Links</h1>\n<p>Project Link - <a href=\"https://github.com/NeuralDev-io/arclytics_simcct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/NeuralDev-io/arclytics_simcct</a></p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"Arclytics","date":"31 Oct 2019","tags":["javascript","html","css"],"path":"projects/arclytics","excerpt":"This is the first big projects I worked on.","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='400'%20height='297'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20297'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M175%2021c-22%204-43%2014-59%2030l-6%206H89l-22%201a333%20333%200%200021%2038l-2%209c-13%2054%2020%20112%2074%20128l9%203%2011%2019%2012%2019%2012-19%2011-20%208-2a109%20109%200%200075-129l-2-9%208-13%2011-19%203-5-22-1h-22l-6-6c-25-24-60-35-93-30M74%2059a233%20233%200%200030%2018l21%2012%2016%209h103l22-13a5688%205688%200%200144-26%207676%207676%200%2000-236%200m0%206a3552%203552%200%200179%20138l21%2035%2017%2029v-77l-3-6-7-11-35-61-6-12-33-19C68%2059%2071%2061%2074%2065m205%2016l-34%2019-13%2022a12588%2012588%200%2001-38%2066v78l12-20A25694%2025694%200%2001312%2062l-33%2019'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":1.3513513513513513,"src":"/webfolio/static/b08f8b52860e22b4e01f9de7e95b9290/a7715/logo.jpg","srcSet":"/webfolio/static/b08f8b52860e22b4e01f9de7e95b9290/8f7df/logo.jpg 250w,\n/webfolio/static/b08f8b52860e22b4e01f9de7e95b9290/0f3a1/logo.jpg 500w,\n/webfolio/static/b08f8b52860e22b4e01f9de7e95b9290/a7715/logo.jpg 1000w,\n/webfolio/static/b08f8b52860e22b4e01f9de7e95b9290/37d86/logo.jpg 1500w,\n/webfolio/static/b08f8b52860e22b4e01f9de7e95b9290/a41d1/logo.jpg 2000w,\n/webfolio/static/b08f8b52860e22b4e01f9de7e95b9290/b4640/logo.jpg 2034w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"postPath":"projects/arclytics","translations":[{"hreflang":"en","path":"/projects/arclytics"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["4097791827"]}
